These files are directly copyied from newlib (libgloss).
The only change is to add an underscore (`_`) to the names,
so that they can easily link to the library itself.

I prefer to use those instead of relying on libnosys as:

 - they don't return errors in case there are no errors;
 - they support some of the functionality, when present;
 - my work can in theory be upstreamed, once stable enough.

Another advantage of this approach is branch pruning: many
of the functions will always fail or will return a constant
value. By having directly inside libgloss and having libc
not define them (see configure.host), would make it possible
to reduce the amount of code that gets generated. Given the
very limited amount of FLASH memory available (16KiB) it 
would be a very good idea to follow this path.
